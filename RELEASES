0.3 Bugfix
	
	Previous versions did not allow entering C-g in programs using
	pseudo terminals like gnome-terminal. This is now fixed.

0.2 Bugfixes+New Features
    
    1. softbeep script fixed, didn't export environment variables
       correctly

	2. Program name is passed to sound player. This allows individual
       beeps for different programs.

	3. esdplay is no longer called directly, a short script wraps it
       and distuingishes between irssi/xchat and other programs.
